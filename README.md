# CommonPCLock
A simple tool I created to make my job easier, to hide Common PC's settings from users.

This tool will:
1. Hide System Apps and Control Panel
2. Remove most of the options from System Apps if it is being exploted
3. Remove lock PC button and function
4. Remove access and install new apps from Windows Store without distrubing update existing preinstalled apps.

Only tested on Windows 10
